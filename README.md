# How to install R Shiny apps on QUBESHub

This is a simple example used to demonstrate what is needed to host your [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app on [QUBESHub](https://qubeshub.org).  This particular example is Joe Cheng's [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) Shiny app that uses the [iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
